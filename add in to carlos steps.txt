when updating a record: get record *to delete* from Carlos' loaded file that he sent back

be sure to REMOVE spaces at ends of URLs

and MAKE SURE URLs are plain text in excel, currently Carlos is having trouble with these- something else is stored in these cells
hidden newline in excel??? hidden space???
